  "text": "The law does not require cosmetic labeling to have FDA approval before cosmetic products go on the market, and FDA does not have a list of approved or accepted claims for cosmetics. However, there are limits that apply to cosmetic labeling claims.\nUnder the law, information on cosmetic labeling, including claims, must be truthful and not misleading. In addition, if a product is marketed with claims for purposes such as treating or preventing disease, or affecting the structure or function of the body—including the skin—it’s a drug according to the law, and it must meet the requirements for drugs, even if it affects the appearance.\nBecause FDA does not have the authority to approve claims before cosmetics go on the market, you may see cosmetics with claims that go beyond what the law permits. FDA monitors cosmetics on the market, and we can take action against companies that break the laws we enforce.
