  "text": "Consumers and manufacturers sometimes have questions about the term \"cosmeceutical.\"\nThe term \"cosmeceutical\" has no meaning under the law. While the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) does not recognize the term \"cosmeceutical,\" the cosmetic industry uses this word to refer to cosmetic products that have medicinal or drug-like benefits.\nA product can be a drug, a cosmetic or both. The FD&C Act defines drugs as those products that cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease or that affect the structure or function of the human body, if a product makes such claims it will be regulated as a drug. Cosmetics are intended to beautify, promote attractiveness, alter appearance or cleanse; they are not approved by FDA for sale nor are they intended to effect structure or function of the body.\nMore resources:\nJuly 6, 2017.
