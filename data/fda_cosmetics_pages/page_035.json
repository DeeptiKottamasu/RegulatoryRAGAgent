  "text": "FAQs Main Page\nHypoallergenic cosmetics are products that manufacturers claim produce fewer allergic reactions than other cosmetic products. Consumers with hypersensitive skin, and even those with \"normal\" skin, may be led to believe that these products will be gentler to their skin than non-hypoallergenic cosmetics.\nThere are no Federal standards or definitions that govern the use of the term \"hypoallergenic.\" The term means whatever a particular company wants it to mean. Manufacturers of cosmetics labeled as hypoallergenic are not required to submit substantiation of their hypoallergenicity claims to FDA.\nThe term \"hypoallergenic\" may have considerable market value in promoting cosmetic products to consumers on a retail basis, but dermatologists say it has very little meaning.\nTo learn more, see Hypoallergenic Cosmetics.\nMore Resources:"
