  "text": "Under U.S. law, cosmetic products and ingredients do not need FDA approval before they go on the market. The one exception is color additives (other than coloring materials used in coal-tar hair dyes), which must be approved for their intended use. Companies and individuals who market cosmetics have a legal responsibility to ensure the safety of their products. In order to take action for safety reasons against a cosmetic on the market, we need reliable information showing that it is unsafe when consumers use it according to the directions in the labeling or in the customary or expected way.\nThe resources listed below are related to cosmetic products that people often inquire about. For resources on cosmetic ingredients, see Cosmetic Ingredients."
