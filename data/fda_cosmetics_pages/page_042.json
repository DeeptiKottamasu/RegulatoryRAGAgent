  "text": "FDA often receives questions from soap makers about how their products are regulated. Here is information to help small-scale soap producers understand the laws and regulations they need to know about.\nHow are traditional soaps and synthetic detergents different?\nOrdinary soap is made by combining fats or oils and an alkali, such as lye. The fats and oils, which may be from animal, vegetable, or mineral sources, are degraded into free fatty acids, which then combine with the alkali to form crude soap. The alkali reacts with the oils, turning what starts out as liquid into blocks of soap. When made properly, no lye remains in the finished product. In the past, people commonly made their own soap using animal fats and lye that had been extracted from wood ashes.\nToday there are very few true soaps on the market. Most body cleansers, both liquid and solid, are synthetic detergent products. Detergent cleansers are popular because they make suds easily in water and don't form gummy deposits. Many of these detergent products are marketed as \"soap\" but are not true soap according to the regulatory definition of the word.\nWhat’s FDA's regulatory definition of soap (21 CFR 701.20)?\nFDA’s regulatory definition of soap includes the following three conditions; all three conditions must be met to be a soap under FDA’s regulatory definition:\nHow are different “soap” products regulated?\nWhat if my ingredients are “natural” or “organic”?\nTo learn more, see Product Testing of Cosmetics. To learn more about “organic” requirements, see ‘Organic’ Cosmetics and the National Organic Program (USDA)."
