  "text": "The Federal Food, Drug, andÂ Cosmetic Act does not require cosmetic products and ingredients to be approved by FDA before they go on the market, except for color additives that are not intended for use as coal tar hair dyes. However, they must be safe for consumers under labeled or customary conditions of use. Companies and individuals who market cosmetics have a legal responsibility for the safety of their products and ingredients.\nThe resources listed below are related to cosmetic ingredients that people often inquire about. For resources on cosmetic products, see Product Information."
