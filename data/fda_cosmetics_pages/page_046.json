  "text": "FDA has the legal authority to inspect cosmetic establishments as well as cosmetics offered for import. Here are resources to learn more about FDA inspection of cosmetics.\nSection 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) authorizes FDA to conduct inspections of cosmetic firms at reasonable times, in a reasonable manner, and without prior notice in order to assure compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, to determine whether cosmetics are safe and properly labeled, and to identify possible health risks and other violations of the law.\nA number of factors affect how FDA determines that an inspection of a cosmetic establishment may be warranted. These factors may include--but are not limited to--the type of products, the significance of consumer or trade complaints received, the company's compliance history, FDA surveillance and compliance initiatives, and agency resources.\nSome things to know about inspections:\nUnder the FD&C Act, imported cosmetic products must comply with all the regulatory requirements that apply to domestic products (FD&C Act, section 201(b). They are subject to examination and/or sampling through U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry. Foreign cosmetics that appear to be adulterated or misbranded (FD&C Act, sections 601 and 602) may be refused entry into the United States. Shipments found not to comply with U.S. laws and regulations are subject to detention. They must be brought into compliance, destroyed, or re-exported (FD&C Act, section 801). Not all imported products are examined at the time of entry. Those not examined, however, are still subject to all the legal requirements of the laws we enforce.\nRelated Resources:"
